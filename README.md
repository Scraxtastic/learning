# requirements

- node v12+ (v12+ cause we use [`globalThis`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/globalThis#Browser_compatibility))
- a browser
- yarn (globally installed)

# folder structure

- `docs/`: here you find any documentation (f.e. the gitflow)
- `code/`: here you find code (NO WAY!), any furthermore structure inside the code-root you'll find in the `code/README.md`

## dependencies globally?

- `@types/jest`: required to calm the editor in test-files
